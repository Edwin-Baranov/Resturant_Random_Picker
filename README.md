# Resturant Random Picker: MVP_Project

This is a web app project created using React, Node.js, expressJS that will search a given area for all food establishments using Google's Places api, filter out any duplicate franchised entries and display a randomly pick one with the Google Maps api.

This project was part of an assignment for Hack Reactor where we were tasked to create a product within a limited time and only focus on making the Minimum Viable Product. The amount of allocated time for this project was 2 days.

Instructions to run:
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* run `npm install`
* add your Google Maps api to the `tokens.js` file
* run `npm run build`
* run `npm start`
* open `localhost:3000`
