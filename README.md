# MVP_Project - Resturant Picker

This is a web app project created using React that will search a given area for all food establishments using Google's Places api, filter out any duplicate franchised entries and display a randomly pick one with the Google Maps api.

This project was part of an assignment for Hack Reactor where we were tasked to create a product within a limited time and only focus on making the Minimum Viable Product. The amount of allocated time for this project was 2 days.
